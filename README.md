AIR QUALITY INDEX ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF NEW DELHI

 Air pollution has been one of the biggest problems for Delhi for years now. Several people develop health related issues ,both minor and severe due to it every year. Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used by government agencies to measure the air pollution levels and communicate it to the population. As the AQI rises, a significant portion of the population is likely to experience negative health effects . With this in mind, Delhi needs an air quality forecast system that can accurately predict pollutant concentration during episodes of high pollution episodes to the public ahead of time. Three different State of art Machine learning algorithms - Random Forest Regression (RF) , XG Boost and Support Vector Regression were used to predict Air quality parameters like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO, NOx.24h air quality data was obtained for training these machine learning models. These models were trained using a dataset which was obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website. The dataset contains daily reading of various AQI parameters like PM2.5 , PM10, CO , NOx, NO etc , out of these parameters PM10 , CO , NO were used to predict PM2.5 , all other parameters had a lot of null values or acted as outliers so they were not used in training and testing.On testing the models it was observed that Random forest regression gave the maximum accuracy of 92.5% followed by XG Boost which gave 85.4%.
